Tax and Technology Attorney
======
**Background**

Prior to law school I developed websites, software and worked in IT. Now I am a tax and technology attorney in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, with a practice focused on all matters tax -- be it estate planning, indirect taxation (sales, VAT, etc.) -- as well as technology contract drafting (SaaS, software licenses, etc.). I spend my off hours renovating a historic home in Medford, New Jersey. 

Before working as an attorney I worked as a legal intern in the Office of General Counsel at Independence Blue Cross in Philadelphia and as a law clerk with a small firm in Atlantic City.

I relish spending time with my wife and daughter, enjoy playing with my three dogs, and acknowledge the presence of a one cat.
